<h1>Session Edit</h1>
<div>
    Warning: You need to be very careful editing session information directly.
    <br> For instance, if you add a big point on a session, the company will lose as the point.
    <br> Do this with care.
    <br> Use case
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You want to change teacher.
            <br> For instance, teacher A cannot teach. And teacher B can teach. Normally, Teacher B create a schedule and Student
            reserve. There might be some inconvience with it. What if the class begin time has almost started? In that case
            you can quickly change teacher idx.
        </li>
        <li>
            You want to share the session point between teacher and student.
            <br> Class went wrong and decided to share half for teacher and half for student.
            <br> You can deduct the point by half on the session. and add half of the point into student's account.
        </li>
        <li>
            Teacher and student want to agree to have a make up class( which we prohibit though).
            <br> You can simply change the date and class begin so, the class will be like 'undone'.
        </li>
        <li>
            For some tests, you can freely change the ssion information.
        </li>
    </ul>
